# Application of Cloud Application Development in Smart Grids
This project was developed as part of the course Cloud Application Development in Smart Grids.
The application is a simplified clone of Stack Overflow, demonstrating the use of Microsoft Azure services such as Table Storage, Blob Storage, and Queue Storage, all integrated through the local Azure Storage Emulator.

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with cloud-based data storage, message processing, and scalable application design by replicating key features of a modern community-driven Q&A platform.
